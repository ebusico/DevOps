# DevOps-O6
## Introduction
### Brief

Use Ansible to automate the deployment of Bursary Management application onto an AWS EC2 instance. Must be able to install each of the application components onto the new instance and confgure correctly with any dependencies, and containerisation. Set up Jenkins job to execute the Ansible code upon each successful build. Terraform could also be used to automate the creation of the EC2 instance on AWS and initialise it with a pre-set-up book disk or simply run ansible code to install any required dependencies.


### Tasks

* Learn how to use Anisble.
* Get deployable version of application.
* Determine all steps required to install application onto a fresh VM.
* Set-up Ansible code to deploy application to a cloud-hosted VM instance via SSH.
* Get containerisation code from other team memeber and implement.
